        <h3>Description</h3>
        This is one of my favorite vegan recipes to use leftover jasmine rice. The key to Korean fried rice is to use one-day-old, leftover rice; freshly cooked rice causes the fried rice to be sticky and soggy in texture. I usually present this dish on a square plate. Garnish with green onions, cherry tomatoes, sesame seeds, and cilantro to bring color and provide an extra visual of texture and crunch.

        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add red onion, garlic, and ginger. Cook, stirring occasionally, until onion softens, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to high and add chopped kimchi and vinegar. Stir in cooked rice, soy sauce, sugar, soy sauce, kimchi brine, and sesame oil.
