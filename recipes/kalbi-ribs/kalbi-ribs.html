        <h3>Description</h3>
        On my half-day off, I decided to relax by making my favorite Korean meat dish, kalbi (marinated short ribs). Serve with white rice and kimchi. If serving small children (and wanting to prevent a mess), it's best to cut the meat off the bone and slice into bite-sized pieces. The dark marinade can stain clothes, so be careful.
