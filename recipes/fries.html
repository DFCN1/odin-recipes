<p>My family loves seasoned fries and with 4 children the bag of fries from the store became too expensive. </p> <p>So I tried batter â€” after all, it makes chicken, shrimp, and onion rings crispy so why not potatoes!</p><p> Now even my husband can't get enough of these French fries.</p><p>They even stay crispy when you reheat them in the microwave.</p>
<ol>
    <li>Slice the potatoes and place them in cold water to prevent browning.</li>
    <li>Sift the flour and seasonings, then gradually stir in water to make a batter.</li>
    <li>SDrain and dry the sliced potatoes, then dip in the batter. </li>
    <li>Fry the potatoes until golden brown and crispy. </li>

</ol>
